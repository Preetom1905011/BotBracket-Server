# BotBracket
This is my First Project using MERN Stack. This is the FrontEnd Part.
Check out the website here: https://botbracketcrr.netlify.app/

## To make Robot Fights Easier to Manage
I made this website for the Combat Ready Robotics Club at Arizona State University. 
CCR hosts Sun Devil Smackdown, a robot fighting tournament, and they use a special betting style
tournament. BotBracket was made to support that tournament style. It also has authorization, so your 
tournament details and history are safe. However, I haven't added the "reset password" functionality (maybe in future?)
so DON'T FORGET YOUR PASSWORD!

## How To Use
- Scroll down and look at Scrappy and What Combat Ready Robotics is all about
- Go to login and sign up
- Once loggedIn, you can add a new tournament.
- Now go to Roster page and add all the participants. (There's a safety list requirement,
  so no unsafe bot can participate). You don't have to add all the participants at the start.
  They can be added at any time.
- Finally, you're ready to go to Bracket page and select the two bots that will fight.
- You'd have to select how many chips each bot bets. The winner will receive the loser's betted chips
- You can then set the timer, start and pick winner at point during the fight.
- Clicking "End Match" will end the match and update the leaderboard and match history
- You're all set! Go on and have fun!

## Note
- Initial login and signup takes a bit time, so please be patient.
- To select winner, press on the toggle "Winner" button, not the Match Cards.
- If you want to reset the match and start over, DO NOT PRESS "END MATCH". END MATCH button will add the match to the match history
  and all your rankings will go wack. Press the RESET button on the timer instead.
- If you have a forced dark mode on your browser, the colors will be all wack.
- That's it :]
